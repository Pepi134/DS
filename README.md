# 🌍 Earthquake Predictor

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Earthquake Predictor** is a data science project that leverages machine learning models to analyze seismic data and predict potential earthquakes. The project aims to help researchers and disaster management agencies take proactive measures by identifying patterns and forecasting earthquake occurrences based on historical data.

## 🔬 Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: Gathered earthquake data from sources such as USGS (United States Geological Survey) or other open datasets.
2. **Data Cleaning & Processing**: Handled missing values, normalized features, and extracted relevant seismic indicators.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Selected key features like magnitude, depth, latitude, longitude, and time intervals.
4. **Model Training**: Applied machine learning algorithms such as XGBoost, Random Forest, or LSTMs for time-series prediction.
5. **Evaluation**: Assessed model accuracy using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and confusion matrices.
6. **Visualization**: Plotted seismic trends using Matplotlib and Seaborn for better insights.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow (for deep learning models), XGBoost
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- **Deployment**: Flask (for API), Streamlit (for interactive UI)

## 🚀 Installation & Usage
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python (≥3.8) installed. You can install the required dependencies using:
